# esm-patient-chart

This microfrontend provides the underlying framework on top of which all the individual widgets are run. It sets up the layout of the patient chart and handles routing between the chart summary and widget dashboards. It also sets up core extensions, the workspace, the side and nav menus, visits functionality as well as offline mode. It also contains the patient banner that displays the patient's name, their avatar, gender, age and identifiers, as well as an expandable panel that shows their address, contact details and relationships with other patients. The patient banner can also display custom tags to mark out whether a patient has an active visit ongoing or whether they are deceased.
